# Taiwan Dengue Cases Analysis

## Introduction

Dengue fever has been a pressing public health concern and was documented to have a ten-fold surge worldwide from 2000 to 2019 ([World Health Organisation, 2023](https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2023-DON498)). It is spread by mosquitoes and are generally more common tropical regions, including places such as Taiwan and Singapore.

## Imported Cases as the Primary Cause of Outbreaks

Several studies highlight the impact of imported dengue cases on local outbreaks in non-endemic regions such as Taiwan. Reports from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control indicate that Taiwan has historically experienced dengue outbreaks despite not having endemic transmission. Imported cases, particularly from Southeast Asia, have been identified as the primary cause of local outbreaks.

A study published in PubMed Central supports this claim, stating that continuous importation of Dengue Virus (DENV) strains from neighboring countries remains the major driver of dengue epidemics in Taiwan.[@yung2015] In 2019, Taiwan reported 540 imported cases, making local containment more challenging. The COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2022) led to a temporary decline in imported cases due to strict border controls, resulting in fewer local outbreaks. However, after the easing of restrictions in 2023, there was a surge of imported cases, contributing to a major outbreak of local cases.[@chiu2024]

## Understanding the Dengue Transmission Dynamics

Dengue Virus (DENV) consists of 4 serotypes - DEN-1 to DEN-4. These are primarily transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. While climate conditions and urbanization contribute to the local spread of dengue, the introduction of infected travelers plays a crucial role in initiating outbreaks. Imported cases introduce new viral strains into non-endemic areas, providing a source for further transmission if competent mosquito vectors are present.[@yung2015]

## Objectives

Our project aims to:

-   Develop interactive visualizations to illustrate the temporal trends in dengue cases across the years, seasons and geographic locations in Taiwan

-   Perform time series forecasting to forecast future dengue cases based on past trends, and evaluate the accuracy of different forecasting models

-   Conduct correlation analysis of dengue cases with external factors

Taiwanâ€™s historical dengue cases data presents a good opportunity to analyze long-term trends and seasonal outbreaks. Useful insights can potentially be discovered to better understand and predict these incidences.
