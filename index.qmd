# Taiwan Dengue Cases Analysis

Dengue fever has been a pressing public health concern and was documented to have a ten-fold surge worldwide from 2000 to 2019 ([World Health Organisation, 2023](https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2023-DON498)). It is spread by mosquitoes and are generally more common tropical regions, including places such as Taiwan and Singapore. Taiwanâ€™s historical dengue cases data presents a good opportunity to analyze long-term trends and seasonal outbreaks. Useful insights can potentially be discovered to better understand and predict these incidences.

Our project aims to:

-   Develop interactive visualizations to illustrate the temporal trends in dengue cases across the years, seasons and geographic locations in Taiwan

-   Perform time series forecasting to forecast future dengue cases based on past trends, and evaluate the accuracy of different forecasting models

-   Conduct correlation analysis of dengue cases with external factors
