    "text": "Motivation\nDengue fever has been a pressing public health concern in tropical regions, including Taiwan and Singapore. Taiwanâ€™s historical dengue cases data presents a good opportunity to analyse long-term trends and seasonal outbreaks.\nOur project aims to:\n\nDevelop interactive visualisations to illustrate the temporal trends in dengue cases across the years, seasons and geographic locations in Taiwan\nPerform time series forecasting to forecast future dengue cases based on past trends, and evaluate the accuracy of different forecasting models\nConduct correlation analysis of dengue cases with external factors\n\n\n\nData Source\nFor this project, the Taiwan Dengue Cases 1998-2024 dataset will be used.\nThe dataset is retrieved from Kaggle.\n\n\nProblems / Issues the project will address\nDengue cases often fluctuate due to seasonal changes. Our project aims to identify key drivers of dengue outbreaks and raise public awareness.\nAdditionally, by leveraging time series forecasting models, we can determine the most suitable model for predicting dengue outbreaks. This enables stakeholders to take proactive rather than reactive measures in response to potential outbreaks.\n\n\nRelevant Related Work\nOn Kaggle, a basic EDA, correlation analysis and predictive modelling have been shared using this dataset:\n\nExploring Dengue Fever Cases in Taiwan: A Data-Driven Approach\n\nWe also identified 2 research papers related to the study of dengue cases that could potentially be useful for our project:\n\nPrediction of annual dengue incidence by hydro-climatic extremes for southern Taiwan\nTemporal patterns of dengue epidemics: The case of recent outbreaks in Kaohsiung\n\n\n\nProposed Approach\n\nLoad the relevant R packages\nAdditional datasets, such as rainfall and temperature of Taiwan, might be required\nData cleaning and creating additional relevant feature\nEDA\nCorrelation analysis\nTime series analysis\nTime series forecasting\nBuild Shiny dashboard for interactive visualization\n\nThe group will be working on tasks 1-4 together and will split up to work on tasks 5-8.\n\n\nPrototypes / Story Boards"
