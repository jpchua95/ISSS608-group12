We are Group 12, nice to meet you 😊\n\n\nTaiwan Dengue Cases Analysis\nDengue fever has been a pressing public health concern and was documented to have a ten-fold surge worldwide from 2000 to 2019 (World Health Organisation, 2023). It is spread by mosquitoes and are generally more common tropical regions, including places such as Taiwan and Singapore. Taiwan’s historical dengue cases data presents a good opportunity to analyze long-term trends and seasonal outbreaks. Useful insights can potentially be discovered to better understand and predict these incidences.\nOur project aims to:\n\nDevelop interactive visualizations to illustrate the temporal trends in dengue cases across the years, seasons and geographic locations in Taiwan\nPerform time series forecasting to forecast future dengue cases based on past trends, and evaluate the accuracy of different forecasting models\nConduct correlation analysis of dengue cases with external factors\n\n\n\nMeet The Team\nZanelle Lee Wenfang\n\nChua Jia Peng"

Our project aims to identify key drivers of dengue outbreaks and raise public awareness.\nAdditionally, by leveraging time series forecasting models, we can determine the most suitable model for predicting dengue outbreaks. This enables stakeholders to take proactive rather than reactive measures in response to potential outbreaks.\n\n\nRelevant Related Work\nOn Kaggle, a basic EDA, correlation analysis and predictive modelling have been performed using this dataset:\n\nExploring Dengue Fever Cases in Taiwan: A Data-Driven Approach\n\nWe also identified 2 research papers related to the study of dengue cases that could potentially be useful for our project:\n\nPrediction of annual dengue incidence by hydro-climatic extremes for southern Taiwan\nTemporal patterns of dengue epidemics: The case of recent outbreaks in Kaohsiung\n\n\n\nProposed Approach\n\nLoad the relevant R packages\nAdditional datasets, such as rainfall and temperature of Taiwan, might be required\nData cleaning and creating additional relevant features\nEDA\nCorrelation analysis\nTime series analysis\nTime series forecasting\nBuild Shiny dashboard for interactive visualization\n\nThe group will be working on tasks 1-4 together and will split up to work on tasks 5-8.\n\n\nPrototypes / Story Boards"

    "text": "Issues/Discussions\n\nThe team discussed the next steps to be done following Prof Kam’s feedback on the proposal.\n\n\nData Source\n\nProf Kam suggested for the original dataset to be downloaded, instead of using the Kaggle’s version. Both team members tried to download the datasets given from the source link but only managed to download the Dengue_Daily.csv file. An email was set to Prof Kam to request for his copy of the data sets instead.\n\n\n\nReview of geospatial knowledge needed\n\nProf Kam mentioned that more knowledge (not covered in class) would be required to complete the analysis of the chosen dataset. The notes from Geospatial Analysis were reviewed by both team members together. It was accepted that the additional information might be too much to be mastered within the remaining two weeks.\nZanelle suggested that perhaps more work could be done with the data that did not involve the geospatial segment but realised that there might be limited columns to work with (age, gender, number of dengue cases).\nJia Peng highlighted that there would also be significant effort required in the data wrangling segment before being able to be used for analysis. She would also try to get a head start on the preparation and cleaning of the data. It was agreed that a consultation with Prof Kam was required, and was set to be on 19 March, 8.30am-9.30am.\n\n\n\nActions to be done on the data\n\nThe team members reviewed the proposal plan together. While pending Prof Kam’s advice for the feasibility of the project, Jia Peng suggested the team could split the analysis segment. She volunteered to attempt the correlation analysis, and for Zanelle to attempt the time series segment. Both segments could be completed without necessarily involving the geospatial segment of the dataset.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe team has decided to perform data cleaning and some EDA individually before meeting with Prof Kam. Manual visual look through of the dataset will also allow the team to decide on the dataset to be filtered, if relevant.\nThe team will reconvene on 19th March with Prof Kam.\n\n\n\nItems to Discuss for Consultation\n\nFiltering away columns that have many empty values?\nIs it better to keep only the most recent 5-10 years data?\nFeasibility of using this dataset due to lack of geospatial analytics knowledge?"

This is the least preferred topic. \n\n\n\nOther sources\n\nThe team may look for possible datasets from Kaggle and Singapore’s open data portal.\nThe team will each shortlist 3 possible datasets and reconvene on 1 March at 4pm, to finalise 1 dataset for the project proposal."

Time series analysis and forecasting can be performed on the dataset as well.\nZanelle identified potential columns that can be excluded due to too many “None” values which will not be meaningful for the analysis.\nAdditional dataset, such as precipitation and temperature by regions in Taiwan, may be helpful in the analysis as they could be correlated with dengue. The team will source for these information.\n\n\n\nWorkout & Fitness Tracker Dataset\n\nThere is sufficient data for analysis and for building a regression model to recommend workout plans, and assess the impact of workout, sleep and nutrition.\nHowever, the dataset appears synthetic and inaccurate. For example, the recorded water intake for all users is 1.9L. User 9 reportedly ran 13.24 km in 25 minutes, which is faster than the estimated speed of the fastest runner which seems unrealistic, and yet this is classified as a low-intensity workout.\n\n\n\nQuality of Life Index by Country\n\nA possible topic to explore with this dataset is suggesting destinations for relocation. However, the sample size available is very small to work with to potentially provide useful insights, and there is no further breakdown to track the progression of quality of life over time.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe team has decided to proceed with the Taiwan Dengue Cases 1998 – 2024 dataset.\nThe team will perform data cleaning and some EDA individually. The team will also look for dataset on Taiwan’s precipitation and temperature by regions.\nThe team will reconvene after 9th March."

    "text": "Points taken from consultation with Prof\n\nNot a must to explore what senior did, who did extra work on geospatial. There’s another team’s focus is on EDA. Not necessary to go into geospatial. There is sufficient data to go into EDA and CDA.\nLocate and analyse outbreak during the few months of particular years\nTIME SERIES\n\nTo use curve fitting or statistical curve since it is not a typical time series. Typical time series would usually look at recurrences. X axis to be time interval (weekly, epi week) and Y axis to be number of occurrences (i.e. number of dengue cases.)\nDisease outbreak (spikes) will not be normal distribution. Can explore negative binomial, poisson, exponential distriutions and see which one fits best.\n\nDengue - monitor in epidemiological week (Epi Week). Lubridate - compute epi-week. To look at weekly data. Usually relatively short, should take note when it starts and when it starts to peak. Use time frame when event start, chopping the start and end (refer to hands on)\nTaiwan is very careful with 3(?) diseases, dengue being one of them. Dengue is popular in equatorial zone. In recent years, dengue has spread to temperate zone. Taiwan is far from equatorial, and many people visit from these countries and leading to outbreak\nThere are some missing values and errors, e.g. no gender, GPS location, excluding a few of these is fine. Will not affect the entire results\nDengue tends to be more significant for foreigners’ cases than locals. Locals tend to build up immune system. Foreigners’ symptoms are more serious and tend to be confirmed cases. During the outbreak, can evaluate foreign carrier vs local spread.\n2 major outbreaks in dataset (2015 and 2023 after viewing dataset), if no data means no cases (Taiwan case reporting is very detailed). Will need to look into background of Dengue and whether cases are spread via foreigners entering Taiwan (since Taiwan is not near the equator) and also look into the outliers by map location (some places have plenty of cases, some have just a few). Check during outbreak period if there are more foreigners or locals, look at the trends, peak periods (week/month).\nCan allow users to play with ancillary data for SHINY app e.g. age, gender, local/foreigner, travelled recently, difference between local and imported cases etc. To also note that X-Y coordinate is a grid, which protects data of individuals."
